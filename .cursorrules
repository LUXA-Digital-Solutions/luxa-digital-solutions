# LUXA Digital Solutions - Project Intelligence

## Project Overview
LUXA Digital Solutions is a premium digital services company website built with React 18, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project showcases professional services, portfolio work, and company expertise with a focus on high-end client acquisition.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Component Architecture
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Follow atomic design principles with shadcn/ui components
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use custom CSS animations for premium feel (float, glow, slide-up)

### Styling Patterns
- Primary color: Cyan (#00D4D4) - use for CTAs and brand elements
- Dark theme with subtle gradients and backdrop blur effects
- Custom CSS variables in HSL format for consistent theming
- Responsive breakpoints: mobile (default), md (768px+), lg (1024px+), xl (1280px+)

### Animation System
- Entrance animations: slide-up effects for content sections
- Hover effects: lift animations with shadow-cyan glow
- Micro-interactions: subtle transforms and transitions
- Performance: CSS-based animations for smooth performance

### Data Management
- Portfolio data centralized in `src/data/projects.ts`
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Project structure includes comprehensive case study information
- Static data approach for current implementation
